# Elmstagram

A basic UI-clone of [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/) using [Elm](http://elm-lang.org/).

Inspired by [Wes Bos'](https://twitter.com/wesbos) great [Redux course](https://learnredux.com/).

## Build

```bash
$ make
```

## Run

After building use a static file server to host the `dist` directory.
Alternatively just open `dist/index.html` in your browser.

```bash
$ make run
```
